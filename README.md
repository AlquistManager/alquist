Alquist
=======
Alquist is dialogue manager created by Jakub Konr√°d and Petr Marek.

## Installation
You need Python 3. 

We use WIT.ai as our npl service currently so you will need to install WIT as well

	pip install wit
	
To run Alquist use command

	py -3 main.py [port] [webhook URL] [wit server access token] [Folder containing yamls]
``Port`` field defines the port on which the Alquist will run.
``Webhook URL`` field defines the URL of webhoook, where responses will be send.
``WIT server access token`` defines which wit.ai app will you use. For our demo use ``NXOFXMBCIA6YAIXNNWYXJIJPC22AK35V``
``Folder containing yamls`` path to folder, where yaml files are located.
For example

	py -3 main.py 5000 http://964bdc06.ngrok.io NXOFXMBCIA6YAIXNNWYXJIJPC22AK35V C:\Users\user\yaml\
You can use ngrok to run webhook on your localhost.

## API
### Register new session
To begin with dialogue, you have to register new user. You register new user by POST request to 

	http://127.0.0.1:5000/start
You can test it by CURL

	curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/start"
The answer is JSON containing ``session_id`` of new user. Use this ``session_id`` for further communication with the dialogue manager.

### Sending input
To send input send POST with JSON containing fields ``session_id`` and ``text`` request to

	http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Obtaining of ``session_id`` is described in ``Register new user`` section. The ``text`` field contains text, which you want to send to the dialogue manager.
You can test it by CURL

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=\"utf-8\"" -X POST -d "{\"session_id\":\"INSTERT_SESSION_ID\", \"text\":\"text\"}" "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
The answer is JSON with field ``OK`` containing value ``true`` or ``false``. Dialogue's manager response is send to webhook defined during start of dialogue manager.
