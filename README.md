All information about writing your bot is here https://github.com/AlquistManager/alquist-yaml-editor/blob/master/How%20to%20write%20your%20bot.md

## Installation
You need Python 3. 


We use PyYaml. You need to install it by

    pip install PyYaml

We use Flask-Cors. You need to install it by

    pip install -U flask-cors
    
We currently use WIT.ai as our nlp service so you will need to install WIT as well

	pip install wit
	
Alternatively we are testing nlp created using [MorphoDiTa tool](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita) ([Mozilla Public License 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/)) and [MorfFlex Czech models](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-1674) ([Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)). You will need to install the MorphoDiTa tool package.
	
	pip install ufal.morphodita
	
Additional required packages can be found in requirements.txt file.

## Run
To run Alquist use command

	py -3 main.py
	
You can change Alquist's parameters. They are stored in the ``config.py``.

``port`` field defines the port on which the Alquist will run.

``wit_token`` defines which Wit.ai app will you use. For our demo use ``NXOFXMBCIA6YAIXNNWYXJIJPC22AK35V``

``debug`` displays contents of context while bot is running, useful for debugging, values ``True`` or ``False``

For example:

	config = {"port": 5000,
          "wit_token": "NXOFXMBCIA6YAIXNNWYXJIJPC22AK35V",
          "debug": True}

## Docker
Alquist is prepared to be run in a Docker container. The setup process is quite straightforward.
###Building an image
Dockerfile is already present in the main directory. Run ``docker build -t alquist .`` to build the Docker image for Alquist. Alternatively, you can obtain pre-built image from Docker Hub with the ``docker pull alquistmanager/alquist`` command.
###Launching a container
Once the image is built, run the ``run-docker-container.sh`` bash script. There are two parameters required: First is a port you want Alquist to run on and the second is absolute path to your ``.yml`` files.
