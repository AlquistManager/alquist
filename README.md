``Port`` field defines the port on which the Alquist will run.
``Webhook URL`` field defines the URL of webhoook, where responses will be send. (--- NOT USED CURRENTLY, BUT INSERT SOME VALUE ---)
``WIT server access token`` defines which wit.ai app will you use. For our demo use ``NXOFXMBCIA6YAIXNNWYXJIJPC22AK35V``

## API

###Request
To communicate with Alquist use POST requests to url, on which the Alquist is running. POST have to contains JSON with fields:

- text
    Contains user's input text. You can leave it blank, if user has nothing to say (when the Alquist starts a dialogue and we need to prompt
    it to start for example).
- state
    Name of state, where we currently are. The state is "init" at the start of dialogue usually. Must contain something every time.
- context
    Json object representing context. There must be empty Json object at least every time.
- session
    ID of session used during logging. Can be empty at the start of dialogue.
    
###Response
Response contains JSON with fields:

- text
    List of Alquist's answers. This is the field, which you want to show to user somehow probably.
- state
    Name of new state, where we get to. Use this name in the next request (state field).
- context
    Json object containing updated context. Use this object in the next request (context field).
- session
    Generated ID of session used during logging. Use this ID in the next request (session field).
