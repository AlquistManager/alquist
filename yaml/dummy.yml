name: dummy # Name of the flow, unique for the whole application

intent_transitions: #List of intent and their transitions
  intent1: state2 # Name of intent: state to transition in case of the intent detection in input_user states
  intent2: state3

states: # List of states. States are executed sequentially
  init: # Name of the state. Unique in each flow
    type: message_text # Type of state.
                       # message_text sends text message back to the client
    properties: # list of properties of each state
      text: Hello World!

  state2:
    type: message_text_random # Sends one of the messages listed under responses
    properties:
      responses: # List of responses
        - Hello!
        - Hi!
    delay: 1000 # shows message 1000 millisecend after previous output or user input

  state3:
    type: input_user # Prompts cliends and waits for his response
    properties:
      entities: # List of entities expected in client's answer
        entity1: date # context key: entity
      log_json: true # determines if NLP JSON structure is stored in context
                     # only stores latest user prompt as JSON
      require_match: true # determines if expected entities are required
    transitions:
      match: state4 # transition when the entities are matched
      notmatch: state4 # transition when the entities are not matched

  state4:
    type: input_context # Reads latest logged JSON user query as input
    properties:
      entities:
        entity1: date
        entity2: location

  state5:
    type: conditional_equal # Compares two values and using transition creates corresponding branches
    properties:
      value1: '{{ intent }}' # Here we use value of a context key intent
      value2: greeting # We compare string "greeting"
    transitions: # defines transition states for both branches
      equal: positive_case # transition for when values are equal
      notequal: negative_case # transition for when values are not equal

  state6:
    type: conditional_exists # used to determine if selected key exists in current context
    properties:
      key: '{{ intent }}' # context key to check
    transitions:
      exists: positive_case # transition for when key exists
      notexists: negative_case #  transition for when the key doesn't exist

  state7:
    type: UserDefinedState # used to call user defined action
    properties: # list of action parameters
      param1: [p1]
      param2: [p2]
    transitions:
      flow: flow2  # jump to the first state of next flow


# Dialogue finishes and context resets automatically after reaching the end of the flow
# Alternatively, user can force dialogue end by tag return:true

  return_example: # Name of the state.
    type: message_text # Type of state.
    properties: # list of properties of each state
      text: Hello World!
    transitions: return # return tag
